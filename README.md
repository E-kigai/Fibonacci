# Fibonacci Series in C

This is a simple C project that prints the Fibonacci sequence using two different methods:

- **Loop version**
- **Recursive version**

## Files

- `fibonacci.c` — Main file that handles user input and calls the chosen method.
- `fib_loop.c`, `fib_loop.h` — Contains the loop-based implementation.
- `fib_recursive.c`, `fib_recursive.h` — Contains the recursive implementation.

##  How It Works

When you run the program:

1. You enter how many Fibonacci numbers you want.
2. You choose which method to use:
   - **1** → Loop version
   - **2** → Recursive version
3. The program prints the Fibonacci series accordingly.
